// Lesson 01 exercise: Running JavaScript three ways
// Clone the exercise repository for this course, https://github.com/Leon-Arno/JS-Exercises, to
// your computer.
// Make the copy your own. Inside the cloned folder, delete the `.git` folder to remove the
// connection to the original repository: run `rm -rf .git` on macOS and Linux, or `Remove-Item
// -Recurse -Force .git` in PowerShell on Windows.
// Run `git init` in the folder, create a new empty repository named `javascript-exercises` on
// your own GitHub account, connect it as the remote, and push. This is the same publishing
// flow you performed in the Git course.
// Create a branch named `lesson-01-exercise` and switch to it, then open `lesson-01.js`. The
// questions are already inside as comments; work through them in order, writing your answers
// directly beneath each one.

// TODO: Part one.
// Start the Node REPL and evaluate at least four arithmetic expressions of your own, using
// more than one operator across them. Copy the complete session transcript and paste it into
// `lesson-01.js` as a comment block where the question asks for it.

// TODO: Part two.
// Write a `console.log` line in `lesson-01.js` that prints a greeting, save the file
// deliberately, and run it with `node lesson-01.js`.

console.log('Hello from lesson 01!');

// TODO: Part three.
// Change the greeting text, run the file again without saving, and observe that the output has
// not changed. Save and run once more, then describe in a one-sentence comment what happened
// and why.

// The output did not change because I had not saved the file. Node.js runs the saved version on disk.

// TODO: Part four.
// Run your greeting line in the Chrome DevTools Console. In a comment, record one way the
// experience matched Node and one way it differed.

// Same: Both Node.js and the browser executed the JavaScript.
// Different: The browser runs JavaScript inside a web page, while Node.js runs it outside the browser.

// TODO: Part five.
// From a folder that does not contain the file, deliberately run `node lesson-01.js` so that
// the terminal reports it cannot find the file. Paste that error transcript as a comment, then
// explain in one sentence how you resolved it.
