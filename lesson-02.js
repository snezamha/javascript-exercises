// Lesson 02 exercise: Variables and data types
// In your exercise repository, create a branch named `lesson-02-exercise` and switch to it,
// then open `lesson-02.js`. The questions are inside as comments, and the file begins with the
// strict mode line. Work through the parts in order, beneath each question.

// TODO: Part one.
// Declare five variables that describe a small shop of your choosing, mixing `const` and `let`
// deliberately and naming everything in camelCase. Log each variable, and add a one-line
// comment justifying every choice between `const` and `let`.

const shopName = "Maple Market";
// const is used because the shop name should not change during this exercise.
const shopCategory = "neighborhood grocery";
// const is used because the shop category is a fixed description.
let dailyCustomerCount = 84;
// let is used because the customer count can change throughout the day.
let openRegisterCount = 2;
// let is used because the number of open registers can change.
const acceptsCardPayments = true;
// const is used because this payment policy is treated as fixed.

console.log(shopName);
console.log(shopCategory);
console.log(dailyCustomerCount);
console.log(openRegisterCount);
console.log(acceptsCardPayments);

// TODO: Part two.
// Log the `typeof` result for each of your five variables, and additionally for `null` and for
// `undefined`. Note in a comment which one of these results is a famous historical bug of the
// language.

console.log(typeof shopName);
console.log(typeof shopCategory);
console.log(typeof dailyCustomerCount);
console.log(typeof openRegisterCount);
console.log(typeof acceptsCardPayments);
console.log(typeof null);
// `typeof null` returning "object" is a famous historical bug in JavaScript.
console.log(typeof undefined);

// TODO: Part three.
// Declare one variable without assigning it a value, and a second variable set to `null` on
// purpose. Log both values and both `typeof` results, and state the difference between the two
// kinds of nothing in one comment sentence.

let currentPromotion;
const scheduledRestockDate = null;
console.log(currentPromotion);
console.log(scheduledRestockDate);
console.log(typeof currentPromotion);
console.log(typeof scheduledRestockDate);
// `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, while `null` is an intentional assignment indicating the absence of any object value.

// TODO: Part four.
// Convert the three provided string values to their intended types using `Number()` and
// `Boolean()`, and convert one number of your own to a string with `String()`. Log each result
// together with its `typeof`, and note in a comment which conversion would produce `NaN` if
// the string were not a clean number.

// * The three provided string values:
const priceText = "4.50";
const countText = "12";
const flagText = "true";

const price = Number(priceText);
const count = Number(countText);
const flag = Boolean(flagText);
const aisleNumberText = String(5);
console.log(price, typeof price);
console.log(count, typeof count);
console.log(flag, typeof flag);
console.log(aisleNumberText, typeof aisleNumberText);
// `Number()` would produce `NaN` if `priceText` or `countText` were not a clean number string.

// TODO: Part five.
// The file ends with a short broken program that contains a reassigned `const`, an assignment
// to a variable that was never declared, and a variable read before its declaration line. Run
// it, read each error message carefully, repair all three problems, and describe each repair
// in one comment line.

// ! This broken program crashes on purpose, one error at a time.
// ! Keep it commented until you reach this part, then uncomment and repair:
// const bakeryName = "Maison Sarah";
// bakeryName = "The Corner Bakery";
// openingHour = 7;
// console.log(loafCount);
// let loafCount = 12;

let bakeryName = 'Maison Sarah';
// `bakeryName` uses `let` because it is reassigned.
bakeryName = 'The Corner Bakery';
const openingHour = 7;
// `openingHour` is declared before assignment to avoid creating an undeclared variable.
let loafCount = 12;
// `loafCount` is declared before it is read.
console.log(loafCount);

// TODO: Part six.
// Two variables, `a` and `b`, hold different values. Swap their contents using a third,
// temporary variable, and log both afterwards to prove the swap succeeded. This is the oldest
// exercise in programming, and it still earns its place.

let a = 'morning';
let b = 'evening';
const temporaryValue = a;
a = b;
b = temporaryValue;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
// TODO: Save deliberately, commit with a clear message, push the branch, and open a pull request
// into main.
// TODO: Submit the link to the pull request for review.
